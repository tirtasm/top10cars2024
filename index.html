                The CT4-V Blackwing has just three-peated 10Best, and for good
                reason. This sports sedan is one of the best driver's cars on
                the market today, right up there with its sibling, the CT5-V
                Blackwing (also a three-time 10Best winner). It looks good, it
                sounds good, and it's something we'd have no trouble living
                with—we did for 40,000 miles.
              </p>
              <p class="card-text">
                It starts with the 472-hp twin-turbocharged 3.6-liter V-6, which
                in its loudest setting emits all manner of pops and burbles,
                meaning we have no choice but to run the bent-six to redline
                over and over. While it's immensely capable with its optional
                10-speed automatic transmission, we say skip the $3175 upcharge
                and stick with the, er, stick. Its precise engagement only adds
                to the sensory assault at full send. And sending the Blackwing
                gives you some of the most rewarding driving this side of the
                six-figure mark. As a bonus, manual-equipped CT4-V Blackwings
                get titanium connecting rods.

                Like its CT4-V sibling, the Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing has
                returned to collect its third 10Best award. Since that is no
                small feat for any car, the CT5-V Blackwing is clearly worth
                every bit of praise dedicated to it. <br />
                <br />
                When was the last time you drove a sedan capable of breaking the
                rear tires loose at highway speeds on dry pavement? With a
                668-hp supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 whining under the hood and
                imitating a Spanish galleon's cannon fire through the tailpipes,
                the CT5-V Blackwing is like bringing a thermonuclear device to a
                knife fight. It is more than you will ever need. But boy howdy,
                do we want all of it.
                <br />
                <br />
                And given what the Blackwing will take from you, you're going to
                have to want it. At $96,990, it costs as much as one and a half
                CT4-V Blackwings. The EPA estimates fuel economy at 13 mpg city
                and 21 mpg highway, numbers that will undoubtedly cascade once
                you realize how much fun the last half of the gas pedal's travel
                can be.

                <p class="card-text">If there were a Mount Rushmore of cars, a likeness of the Accord would be George Washington. Honda's stalwart sedan has long been a towering example of smart engineering, a clear-eyed and consistent vision of what a great family sedan should be. This is the 38th time the Accord has earned a 10Best spot since our award's 1983 inaugural year, the most of any model from any manufacturer. The reason for the Accord's winning streak is simple but one that's hard for other companies to duplicate: continuous improvement of a single model over decades.
                    <br> <br>
                    While most OEMs make incremental improvements, Honda seemingly has a sixth sense for nailing the family-car formula. Generational upgrades have resulted in the Accord becoming bigger, roomier, nimbler, more powerful, quicker, more fuel efficient, more luxurious, better equipped, and more fun to drive. This layer cake of continuous development has made the current 11th-generation model a delicious confection.

                    Looking for a high-mileage commuter that doesn't break the bank? The base LX or Sport sedan with a 2.0-liter engine will do nicely. Want a bit more oomph and better appointments for not that much more coin? The EX and Touring models with the turbocharged 1.5-liter inline-four are your jam. Prefer a four-door hatchback? Sure, they've got those. Want to shift it yourself? The Sport and Sport Touring hatchback models give you three pedals, and if you want a manual performance sedan on a budget, the 200-hp Civic Si is right over here. You can even get it with summer tires.

                <p class="card-text">We're living in a triple-tiered subscription-based world. Gold members get a free bottle of water at check-in. Platinum status lets you board the plane sooner than others. Diamond members, well, they can do just about anything as long as the cops aren't watching. The idea seems to be to make you want more. That's what makes the Lucid Air Pure such a fresh take. It's the most affordable version of an impressive EV. Yet even at this lowest tier, it delivers better EPA range than the most expensive or longest-range electrics from Tesla, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz, or any other EV maker in the market. And the all-wheel-drive Pure's slightly shorter range still exceeds the distance some gas-fed cars can go before refueling. For those reasons, and many others, both Air Pure variants earn our 10Best award. <br></br>

                    But before we dump an entire five-gallon bucket of data and EV vocabulary on your head, let us first explain why the $78,975 Air Pure ($83,975 in all-wheel-drive form) is worth savoring. The Pure only sacrifices what's easy to live without. It wears a body-colored metal roof instead of glass, the frunk lid isn't powered, the front seats aren't ventilated, and the windshield isn't heated.

                    No handicapper would have offered underdog odds on the Porsche 718 Boxster and Cayman making our 10Best list for the 19th time in a row. Only twice since its first year of eligibility in 1998 has a form of Porsche's mid-engine sports car failed to make the cut. Even the 10Best fixture Honda Accord has missed four times during its longer eligibility, and although the Chevrolet Corvette ties the Boxster with 25 all-time wins, it has failed to reach the list no fewer than 15 times. Judging by success rate, the Porsches are 10Best's brightest stars.
<br><br>
                    This is a special kind of excellence, though even as we award another title, it is impossible to deny that the present-generation 718 is showing its age. The current Boxster and Cayman launched as 2017 models, and their interior design is closer to that of the 991-generation 911 than the 992. The 7.0-inch touchscreen's fuzzy graphics feel unexceptional, though the analog gauges still look rich.                
    <br><br>
                    That all barely matters because the Boxster and Cayman continue to exemplify the greatest sports-car virtues. These are cars without slop, hesitation, or apparent filter between man and machine. They make mundane errands feel truly special.

                <p class="card-text">
                    As the SUV-ification of the auto market continues unabated and mega-horsepower EVs quickly become the new hotness in the high-performance space, the Subaru BRZ and Toyota GR86 look more and more like outliers. Small, light, naturally aspirated, and manually shifted, this delightfully analog duo flies in the face of many current trends, and they're all the better for it.

                    Not merely a tonic to prevailing winds, these sports cars are exciting in their own right. During our 10Best testing, the GR86 was often just as quick through the challenging sections as more powerful and more expensive contenders—some vastly so. With their lithe handling, faithful steering, predictable behavior, and plentiful feedback, the GR86 and BRZ encourage you to push harder.
